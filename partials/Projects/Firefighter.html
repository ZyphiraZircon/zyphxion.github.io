<h2>My Little Firefighter</h2>
<br>
<p>This is an ongoing project I'm working on at the request of a friend.  The goal is create and augmented reality game for mobile devices aimed at younger children, in which kids tilt and aim the device to extinguish fires that are appearing "in real life" through the device's camera.
