<h2>Disney Mobile</h2>
<h4>July 2012 - May 2013</h4><br>
<p>At Disney Mobile I worked full time as a Backend Engineer Intern.  
My primary project was leading the development of a large scalable Java server for processing millions of event pings a day from people who launch Disney's iPhone apps, executing many HTTP requests per event directed to Disney's advertising partners.  
I also managed daily database update requests for Disney's user acquisition system, making frequent changes to the MySQL database based on Disney's advertising partners' ever-changing needs.  
In addition, I was in charge of updating each app's "More Disney" webpage, which is a page that can be accessed within the application that links to other suggested Disney apps in the Apple App Store.</p>
